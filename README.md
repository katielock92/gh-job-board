# mx51 API Greenhouse Job Board

This project was bootstrapped using **create-react-app**

## Purpose
This single page web application creates a custom API-driven job board for mx51, using Greenhouse's open APIs. Only GET requests are processed through the API, with the **Apply** link on each position going to the Greenhouse-hosted page to take advantage of their tested and secure POST requests.

This application is front-end only due to no data being submitted or stored on the application itself.

## Commands
* **npm install:** to install all modules locally if project is cloned from Github
* **npm run start:** to run the development build locally
* **npm run build:** to create a production build
